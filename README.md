# EnigmaMachine
Enigma machine implementation, based on Apache Maven tool, including automatic decipher process (using brute force). The machine is a generic one, not limited to a certain scale. The process involved working with multiple threads, files, collections and other OOP concepts and principles (e.g. interfaces, encapsulation, SOLID). The project includes console, desktop and client-server architecture. Familiarity with Spring.

This is a partial outcome of a project which has three parts of seperate excercises. This is an image of the current status at excercise 2, an unfinished result:
